Timestamp,"When I go into a public restroom, I usually choose",(Optional) Describe your decision making process for picking a stall upon entering a public restroom
2/19/2018 6:45:18,The handicap stall,"I almost always pick the handicap stall because it's farthest away from the entrance. It feels more private and spacious. If that is taken, I will usually go to the stall closest to the entrance. I will almost never take the inner stalls. It feels claustrophobic. "

2/19/2018 7:08:28,The stall closest to the entrance,"First and foremost, I find a stall that is not next to an already-occupied stall. But my first choice if they are all open is the stall nearest the entrance "
2/19/2018 7:08:49,One of the inner stalls,It's safer
2/19/2018 7:10:52,The cleanest stall,
2/19/2018 7:11:01,The stall closest to the entrance,I try to avoid the handicap stall in case someone should need it.
2/19/2018 7:11:37,The stall closest to the entrance,
2/19/2018 7:12:18,One of the inner stalls,

2/19/2018 7:17:18,One of the inner stalls,
2/19/2018 7:17:30,The handicap stall,I look for the largest stall since I'm a large person.
2/19/2018 7:19:07,The stall closest to the entrance,First available stalk that is not gross that seems like I will have the least interaction with people in my way in or out
2/19/2018 7:19:48,The stall closest to the entrance,
2/19/2018 7:25:47,The handicap stall,I never choose the closest stall.
2/19/2018 7:26:20,The stall closest to the entrance,The first one is usually the cleanest because everyone goes further down to the second or third etc 
2/19/2018 7:27:15,One of the inner stalls,"In the dorm bathroom I ALWAYS choose the second stall, but I couldn't tell you why. I suppose it's a matter of comfort like how people tend to choose the same seats in a classroom. Furthermore, something about the first stall is just averse to me, but I also don't pick the handicap stall unless necessary."
2/19/2018 7:28:08,The stall closest to the entrance,I choose the stall that has a wall next it. Basically any corner stalls. 
2/19/2018 7:28:43,One of the inner stalls,"Usually use the second/third closest to exit. If in use, I use farthest from entrance. I don't even know why..."
2/19/2018 7:30:53,The cleanest looking,I survey which ones are open and determine which is the most seemingly cleanest stall.
2/19/2018 7:36:23,One of the inner stalls,
2/19/2018 7:37:28,The stall closest to the entrance,"If it's taken, and N=2, I'll use the other one. 

If N>2, I'll put an air gap of one stall between me and the other person. "

2/19/2018 7:38:38,One of the inner stalls,"Go for whatever’s open, but if possible, choose one that’s not adjacent to one being used."

2/19/2018 7:41:06,The handicap stall,"Handicap for space, next choice the one with toilet paper :)"

2/19/2018 7:51:12,How many stalls and which is not occupied,
2/19/2018 7:58:25,The handicap stall,
2/19/2018 7:58:27,One of the inner stalls,"Very little thought it in, just walk to what's available"
2/19/2018 7:59:58,The stall closest to the entrance,Except in bathrooms with fewer than 4 stalls. Ill take the handicap then
2/19/2018 8:00:06,One of the inner stalls,"I overlook the first stall--not sure why--and then roll with the first open stall after that, which tends to be one of the inner ones."
2/19/2018 8:00:18,One of the inner stalls,
2/19/2018 8:01:34,The stall closest to the entrance,

2/19/2018 8:06:30,The handicap stall,
2/19/2018 8:07:54,One of the inner stalls,"I prefer the stalls closer to the entrance, but not the closest.  If someone is there, I try to spread at least one empty stall between us"

2/19/2018 8:10:01,The stall I chose previously. Creature of Habit.,

2/19/2018 8:18:35,One of the inner stalls,"I am assuming the first stall is used most often, so I pick one in the middle."
2/19/2018 8:21:21,One of the inner stalls,"I usually choose the second stall. If that one is taken, I take the third. I suppose I think most people take the first stall so the second one will be 1) unoccupied and 2) clean(ish). "
2/19/2018 8:25:27,The stall closest to the entrance,
2/19/2018 8:30:27,The stall closest to the entrance,"I once heard that the first stall generally has the least amount of germs. It's no big deal if I don't get that one, but it's my line of thinking."
2/19/2018 8:36:31,the open one,"in many public venues, women wait in lines for stalls"
2/19/2018 8:36:48,The stall closest to the entrance,"Supposed to be the less used stall.  If it is taken, I'll go to the farthest stall."

2/19/2018 10:10:44,One of the inner stalls,I choose one that is not next to one that is being used if possible

2/19/2018 11:08:40,the one furthest away from the door ,"I try not to use the handicap stall, since I'm not handicap, but I always try to pick the stall furthest from the door. This is to reduce the number of people who walk by."
2/19/2018 11:10:02,The handicap stall,"I like having the extra space, and it feels more private and farther away from other people in the restroom. I hate public restrooms. "
2/19/2018 11:11:46,The one furthest away from everything possible ever,GET AWAY FROM ME YOU FILTHY ANIMALS
2/19/2018 11:23:22,One of the inner stalls,"I don't like it when people walk by my stall so I try to take one far from the entrance, but I also try not to take the handicap stall if I can help it."
2/19/2018 11:26:30,The stall closest to the entrance,"It is closer, therefor quicker to get in and out. I tend to be on a fairly tight schedule. "
2/19/2018 11:40:00,One of the inner stalls,"The options go as follows:
1 stall open: I pick the stall that is open
Otherwise: Pick the inner stall furthest from the entrance that is cleanest and furthest from other used stalls"

2/19/2018 12:27:47,The stall closest to the entrance,"Minimum walking distance, consistency. If it's taken then I go to the next available stall. I don't really think that hard about it, but sometimes if I frequent a particular public restroom I'll try and exclusively use the same stall every time. It just makes me feel more comfortable, I guess? Because it's ""my"" stall. "

2/19/2018 13:30:59,The handicap stall,"I choose the biggest, furthest from other bathroom users, and furthest from the door."
2/19/2018 13:43:43,One of the inner stalls,
2/19/2018 14:17:24,The handicap stall,"i like to be as far away from center areas as possible and the handicap stall is usually tucked into a corner, nice and safe. if there are droplets on any seat, even if it's probably just water, i will search for anotherone"

2/19/2018 21:28:41,The handicap stall,
2/20/2018 11:09:16,The stall closest to the entrance,I generally just go in and out so if the first one is open its the first one i choose... yet i never want to be directly next to someone (unless its my friend) so i skip a stall if someone is occupying (if space permits)
2/20/2018 14:42:17,Stalls towards the end before the handicapped one.,"I choose the last because of ""heavier duty"" issues."
