	<h1 id="story-title">Last Bit of Coffee</h1>
	<span id="byline"><span id="minutes_read"></span> min read &ndash; November 20th 2017</span>
	<p>The question was:</p>
  <img src="media/last_bit_of_coffee.png">
  <p>And like all of these questions, I had very personal reasons for wondering this. I will now publicly admit, for the first time in my life, that I, Omar Sameh Mahmoud Ahmed Shehata, do indeed never drink the last 10% of coffee.<p>
  <p>This has been something that has always perplexed my girlfriend. She couldn't understand why I was always wasting so much coffee. <i>"Why not just get less coffee?"</i> she'd ask, as if it was so simple. I shared my dilemma with those closest to me, and no one could understand. <i>"Why wouldn't you just drink it all?"</i> they'd say, as if it was somehow my fault. As if this was just some silly quirk.</p>
  <p>I felt like an outcast. Alone. Wondering if anyone out there in the world (or at least on campus) could understand what I had to go through.</p>
  <p>You can see this in the way I asked the question. I was rather apologetic in my phrasing. I didn't even realize this until a supportive friend came up to me and said that my survey was missing a response. I had <i>"Of course, I always drink it"</i> and <i>"I don't always drink it"</i>, but I didn't have a <i>"I never drink it"</i>. She proudly proclaimed that she never drinks the last 10%, and she is not afraid to say it.
  <p>I was in awe. </p>
  <p>It turns out I was not alone after all. By my calculation <i>(stats majors, avert your eyes, I'm breaking all rules of statistical signifiance)</i> there's at least <b>1000</b> students on campus right now who don't always drink the whole thing.</p>
  <br>
  <div class="ct-chart ct-perfect-fourth"></div>
  <h1>Why Staff/Student?</h1>
  <p>You might be wondering why I included the second question. I was mostly just wondering how many people who take this survey are non-students. I did not expect to find a different pattern among staff vs students. I chose to show the results as a stacked bar chart though, because something quite misleading happens when you look at the data as a pie chart.</p>
  <p>This was the default Google forms summary display:</p>
  <img src="media/4_bad_pie.png">
  <p>Do you see the coincidence? This summary implies that there's some connection between not finishing your coffee, and not being a student! They're the exact same number of responses! Of course, that doesn't mean that everyone who said they aren't a student also said they don't finish their coffee. The numbers just happened to line up that way. I was a bit dissapointed this wasn't the case (<i>think of the scandelous headlines we could have had).</i></p>
  <h1>"Heck Yeah" ?</h1>
  <p>Now why did I give a yes or no question 3 answers? If you asked me that while we walked towards each other going in opposite directions on our way to our classes in the hallway, I'd say <i>"It's more fun that way!"</i> before breaking eye contact and walking briskly away.</p>
  <p>The longer answer is that this was really important to me. Every other survey had a blank space where you could write a custom answer. It was a chance to express yourself, and I'd often discover or learn things I'd never thought of. Most surveys don't have this, because it means analyzing the data is harder. I wanted to give people at least some sense of expression.</p>
  <p>So today we learned that most St. Olaf students are pretty okay with being students.</p>
  <p>And if you don't always finish your coffee, you are not alone in this world. There is nothing wrong with you, no matter what they say.</p>
  <p><i>&ndash; Omar</i></p>
