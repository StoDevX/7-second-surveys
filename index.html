	<h2>What's this all about?</h2>
	<p>Every Monday, I send out a super short anonymous survey to the St. Olaf community. All responses are collected <a href="https://github.com/StoDevX/7-second-surveys">here</a> and are free to use for academic purposes, for sheer curiosity, or to settle a drunk bet. </p>
	<p>The following Monday, I post the results along with what cultural or personal significance that question had, and what we learned about our community from it.</p>
	<h2>Why are you doing this?</h2>
	<p>These are the questions that keep me up at night. That I've wondered about for years. That I relentlessly ask to everyone I meet.</p>
	<p>A lot of these questions might seem superfluous but I think who we are is just as much the mundane and trivial decisions we make everyday as it is the large and profound, and I like the idea of being able to document and get to know this community in such an intimate way.</p>
	<h2>I have an idea! Who do I talk to?</h2>
	<p>Awesome! I'm always looking for ideas for more questions! If you've got a question that's highly quirky, oddly specific, or deeply unprofound, shoot me an email at shehat1@stolaf.edu, or <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/G9wdPinKjVU3jDOv2">propose one anonymously</a>.</p>
