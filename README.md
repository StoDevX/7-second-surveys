# 7 Second Survey Series
### _The questions no one cares about, but everyone's wondering_
The Seven Second Survey Series (7SSS) is a project to send out questionaires to the St. Olaf community about the profund, the mundane, and the profoundly mundane. All responses are collected here and are free to use for academic purposes, for sheer curiosity, or to settle a drunk bet.
