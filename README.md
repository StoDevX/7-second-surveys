# 7 Second Survey Series
### _The questions no one cares about, but everyone's wondering_
The Seven Second Survey Series (7SSS) is a project to send out questionaires to the St. Olaf community about the profund, the mundane, and the profoundly mundane. All responses are collected here and are free to use for academic purposes, for sheer curiosity, or to settle a drunk bet.


### Todo 

In preparation for re-starting at the beginning of Spring semester, I would like to:

* Add a "subscribe" link to the header to take you to the mailchimp subscribe form
* Add a "suggest question" link to the header for suggesting questions anonymously. Also add it to the bottom of the page in the paragraph
* Send everyone I think would be interested an invitation to subscribe. 
* All subsequent announcements will go out as mailchimp emails and also as an email to extras, hopefully growing the subscribers list.
